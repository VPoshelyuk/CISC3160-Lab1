### About

A web-application that retrieves information about pokemons from a public API and presents it to a user with a neat UI. Also includes a search function.

- Terminal for command line access  

And this is it! As simple as that, there are no extra dependencies since this is a plain HTML+CSS+JS web-pageðŸŽ‰

### Setup and Usage

1. While you are in the home directory of this repo, press on the green "Code" button in the top right corner.
2. You will be prompted to copy an SSH or HTTPS URL to clone this repo to your local machine.
3. After you got that URL, go to the Terminal on your local machine(I will assume you are on Mac or Linux) and run the following command:

```
4. After all the files are copied to your local machine navigate to the newly created directory using the following command 
```zsh
